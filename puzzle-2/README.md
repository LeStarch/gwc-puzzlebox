# Puzzle Box-2

Welcome to the second GWC puzzle box challenge. This challenge is
designed to teach you Social Engineering. Here the goal is simple:
break the human. In the computer world, the human is often the weak
link in the chain, so forget "hacking" the computer and "hack" the
human instead.

## Program and Problem Space

This is a basic user login prompt. Enter a username and password and
retreive the secret message. The passwords were chosen by weak humans
and are likely memorable to the person whose account you are hacking.
Enter in their personalized password, and you are in!!

How will you break the human?

Your goal should be to see what information you can convince your 
target to leak in order to reveal their password or personality 
(allowing you to guess the password). Leaked information is the key
and it can come in many forms.

Remember:

- Learn about your target, think like them.
- Most humans have very-weak passwords (e.g. "hockey")
- Gain their trust, convince them to give you their password.
- Guesses work well.
- Humans often forget their passwords.
- Have no fear.

*Do NOT* be afraid to try. This is a simulation, teachers and mentors
know what is coming their way (but follow the boundaries below).

## Boundaries

This is a simulation, however; there are boundaries that should be
respected during this time. Please *DO NOT* stalk your target online.
Everything you need can be found in-class, and there is no need to
search on social media, nor other online resources.

## Hints and Tricks

There are several standard attacks that can be used against the
human in order to reveal their information. Here is a run down of 
some of those attacks.

Attacks:

1. *Study and Guess:* many times people use easy-to-guess passwords
that are designed for them to remember. Get in their head, and guess
things that are likely memorable. I had a firend once who locked their
computer with "mynameisangie"...not exactly a hard guess.

2. *Impersonation:* often social engineering is carried out by
pretending to be someone who should be given the password (IT tech,
bank teller, etc.). Targets can be talked out of their password with
a bit of confidence, and playing the part. What would you do if the
SMHS IT staff called asking for your password?

3. *Greed and Fear*: humans are human. They are greedy, and don't
think clearly when stressed. Creating an incentive to work with you
can appeal to greed, and creating an environment of stress and 
consequences for non-compliance can encourage poor decision making.
