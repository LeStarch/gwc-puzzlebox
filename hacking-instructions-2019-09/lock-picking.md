# Lock Picking

Most of the world is protected by keys.  These keys are, at least today, physical devices designed to be unique and protect your items.  However, technical devices, like electronic devices, are only as good as their design.  Just like you can hack a computer, you can hack a lock.  Locksmiths do this quite often to help those of us who tend to lock ourselves out of our apartment.

## How Does a Key Work?

Most mechanical locks have a cylinder that rotates.  In this cylinder there are holes containing small pins of metal.  These pins prevent the lock from spinning when turned.  Take a look at a practice lock and see the tiny pins blocking the cylinder. It cannot spin and is therefore locked.

When a key is inserted, the pin is lifted up the hole until it does not block the cylinder, and the lock can spin open. Using a practice lock, insert a key, notice how the pins are lifted until the entire cylinder is free to spin.  Nothing is blocking it now.  Turning the key rotates the cylinder and the lock opens.

## Lock Picking, an Art

From the key we learned two things, we need to lift the pins and rotate the cylinder. A lock picking set has two primary tools, a “torque wrench”  that provides rotation force and and a “lock pick” that lifts the pins.  Using these tools, you can mimic a key and open the lock.  First, take a lock pick (silver handle, black pick) and insert it into the lock. Try lifting a pin.  You should be able to feel a small force pushing against you.  The practice locks are clear, but normal locks are not.  Thus, once comfortable, try closing your eyes and feel the pick move the pins. If in doubt, ask a mentor for help.

Once you have mastered moving a pin, next take the torque wrench (black metal bar), and put it in the lock.  Use it to rotate the cylinder. The lock won’t open, but you can feel the force required to hold the cylinder against the pins. Too little force, and the pins will not catch when moved to the correct height. Too much force and the pins will bind, becoming impossible to move with the pick.  There is a middle ground you need to find.  Just enough to hold pins without binding.

Next, hold the cylinder “open” as best you can with that middle ground force, and insert the pick again.  Touch each pin, and find the loosest pin.  Lift it, and the torque on the cylinder should catch that pin in the open position.  Repeat for the next loose pin, and repeat for the next until all are open. The cylinder should rotate fully, and the lock should pop open.  **Patience is key**, this is a hard skill to master, don’t be afraid to reset and start over.


## Raking The Pick

Sometimes lifting a single pin is difficult.  Choosing one loose pin can cause another to bind.  Bummer.  There is a simpler technique that can sometimes work.  Take to torque wrench and hold it in the middle ground force.  Next taking your pick, rake it back-and-forth across the pins while wiggling. If done just right, this can lift most pins quickly and the lock will open without giving it time to bind.  

## Pick Types

There are may different pick types.  Experiment to see which works best for you.
