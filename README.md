Puzzle Box
==========

This repository contains code for GWC 2015-2016. This is the source code for a puzzle program designed to allow the GWC class to explore different ways to hack software.

**Note:** This software is designed with bugs in it.  That is the point. The class must exploit these bugs.  DO NOT run it in a production environment, and DO NOT emulate its quality.

This repository contains two programs. 

1. puzzle-box: a program riddled with bugs for the class to exploit. If the correct password is typed, it will print a hidden message. However, it can be exploited to reveal this secret without the password.

2. gen: a basic brute-force password generator
