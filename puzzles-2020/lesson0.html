        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hackers and security personnel are involved in a cat-and-mouse game. Each is trying to outwit the other and
        either protect, or steal data. In this lesson, we will play a full class game to try and show this as well as
        learn about a type of hacking attack.</p>

        <p>We will break into 2 teams: the users and servers, and the hackers. The users and the servers work as a team
        and must communicate back and forth. Users ask a question of the servers, and servers answer the question. Easy,
        right?  However, the hackers get to sit in between and change the questions and returned answers. Now a game is
        afoot!  The users and servers need to work together to try and communicate without letting the hackers in.  The
        hackers must attack and remain unnoticed.</p>

        <table class="table table-dark table-striped">
            <tr><th>Requirements</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Six or more students</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Three mentors</td></tr>
            <tr><td>One activity lead</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Breakout rooms, or ability to do small groups</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Pencil/paper/pen</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Rules</h2>

        <p>This game is all about communication in untrusted environments. The users/servers team will send questions
        and responses back-and-forth. They must be careful to invalidate messages that may be altered or broken by the
        hackers group. This group must also be careful not to invalidate their own messages.</p>

        <p>Hackers on the other hand must know when and how to strike in a way as to remain undetected. They can choose
        to attack whenever they please, but must do so without alarming either of the two endpoints. In order to score,
        the hackers must allow the users and servers to remain blissfully unaware of their influence.</p>

        <table class="table table-dark table-striped">
            <tr><th>Rules</th>
            <tr><td>Setup: Teams are given 3 mins to discuss strategy before a game begins</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Round: one question and response pair</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Game: 6 mins to run as many rounds as possible</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The game is not over until the active round ends</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The users and servers team will be broken into two separated parts</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Points are awarded according to the table below.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Points are awarded secretly and without explanation at the end of each round.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Each team is assigned a mentor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mentors carry the message(s) between groups, but cannot change the message(s) in anyway.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Mentors should not give hints outside the strategy discussion.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Activity lead will float between groups and listen/hint/adjudicate/award points at discretion</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Four games will be played, such that everyone gets try each roll</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Rules, patterns, and reality itself are made to be broken</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Student players shall in no circumstance listen in on the discussions of other groups.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>User and server groups may only directly interact during the strategy phase.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>

        <p>Points are scored according to the below table. Each message, question or response, will score for one team
        or the other. If the message is modified by the hackers, then the condition to score inverts, but the message
        will still score. Only the actions of the user/servers declaring "valid" or "invalid" will result in points,
        however; who scores is dependent on the message history. <em>How points are scored remains secret in order to
        prevent information from leaking about the other team's strategy.</em> Make sure to tack actions such that your
        group can hypothesis what is going on.</p>

        <table class="table table-dark table-striped">
            <tr><th>Scoring Event</th><th>User/Server Points</th><th>Hacker Points</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Unchanged message successfully received</td>      <td>+1</td><td> 0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Changed message detected</td>          <td>+1</td><td> 0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Changed message not detected</td>      <td> 0</td><td>+1</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Unchanged message wrongly errored</td> <td> 0</td><td>+1</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p><em>Note:</em> each message user to server and server to user will score a point for one team or the other.
        Thus two points are available per round, and an infinite but even number of points is expected.  There is a way
        to score an odd number of points.

        <h2>How To Play</h2>

        <table class="table table-dark table-striped">
            <tr><th># </th><th>How it is Played</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1 </td><td>Users decide on a question and hand any message(s) to their assigned mentor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2 </td><td>User's mentor switches to hackers and provides message(s) as-is</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3 </td><td>Hackers decide on any message(s) and provide them to their assigned mentor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>4 </td><td>Hacker's mentor joins servers and provides messages(s) as-is</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5 </td><td>Servers decide if message(s) is valid or invalid. This will score a point for a team.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6 </td><td>Servers decide on any response and hand any message(s) to their assigned mentor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>7 </td><td>Server's mentor switches to hackers and provides message(s) as-is</td></tr>
            <tr><tr><td>8 </td><td>Hackers decide on any message(s) and provide them to their assigned mentor</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9 </td><td>Hacker's mentor joins users and provides messages(s) as-is</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>Users decide if message(s) is valid or invalid. This will score a point for a team.<</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11</td><td>Activity lead tabulates scores, and secretly tell each team's score for the round.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>As described, the game proceeds in this order repeating as many time as needed to fill the game's time limit.
        A game is only finished when the active round ends.</p>
