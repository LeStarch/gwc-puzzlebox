    <p>Try to break the object shown below. Look at what it is asking for, and see if you can get it to behave in a way
    that the designer did not intend. Reload the page if you'd like to reset it.</p>

        <h2>What Just Happened</h2>
        <p>This is what is known as an injection attack. Here we take some form of code and inject it into a system that
        processes that code. In doing this, we tricked the program to run that code.  This can be very dangerous.</p>

        <p>Our pusheen lives on another machine, not the one running this browser. Imagine this pusheen was a zero-size
        image.  The user would not know it is there, but the computer hosting the image would still get a request for it
        and thus know about our user. This is one way you are tracked on the internet.  Advertisers place zero-sized
        images in your page, and when the image loads, their server gets notified. Then they can track you....clever.</p>

        <p>Where can this be dangerous? Think about social media.  What if you could inject code (don't try it) into a
        social media post. Then anyone seeing that post could be tracked (like our image) or would be tricked into
        running code they didn't ask to run.  You could tell their computer what code to run.</p>

        <p>How do we prevent this on our sites?  Rule 1 of security is to always sanitize user input. This means to
        ensure it is not dangerous. For HTML, that means removing all &gt; or &lt; symbols. Without these symbols, no
        tag can be used, and thus it is not possible to inject HTML. For each user input, think about what could be run
        if the input was some type of code and then prevent that code by stripping out needed characters.</p>

        <h2>A Bit of HTML</h2>
        <p>A webpage, at its most basic, is text and special annotations called tags. Text and the tags are called HTML.
        That means everything you are reading here is HTML as drawn (rendered) by your browser. If you want to see this
        HTML, right-click and select "View Page Source". This will display the text along with the tags used to change its
        rendering.</p>

        <p>HTML tags are words inside &lt &gt pairs. These tags tell your browser how to interpret the text and display it.
        For example, &lt h2 &gt is a mid-section header. It means the text is bigger, but not the biggest. The following is
        an example of HTML tags and text:</p>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <pre><code>
                &lth2&gtA Mid Header&lt/h2&gt
                &ltdiv&gt This is a division. It adds a section to your page. &ltem&gtThis is emphasized text.&lt/em&gt&lt/div&gt
                Pusheen: &ltimg src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/f6/8b/cbf68beb6ad6bad1e301a442b6432a45.gif"/&gt
            </code></pre>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>When your browser reads this code, it will run a program to display the rendered output. In the case of our example
            above, the browser will draw the output shown in the box below.</p>
        <div class="card bg-dark">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h2>A Mid Header</h2>
                <div> This is a division. It adds a section to your page. <em>This is emphasized text.</em></div>
                Pusheen: <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/f6/8b/cbf68beb6ad6bad1e301a442b6432a45.gif"/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>These tags are described in the table below. The question a hacker would ask is: what can you now do with
        this information?  Apply what you have learned in all parts of the lesson.  If you are stuck, here is a hint:
        <span class="hint">Can you get the pusheen to display a second time on this page?</span></p>
        <table class="table table-dark">
            <tr><th>Tag</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><td>&lth2&gt</td><td>Secondary section header. Makes text stick out like a section header.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&ltdiv&gt</td><td>Division. These are used to group other tags within.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&ltem&gt</td><td>Emphasis is applied to text within this tag.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&ltimg&gt</td><td>Inserts an image. Specify the URL of the image with src="some/url/here".</td></tr>
