    <h1>Hacking: An Introduction - Girls Who Code - San Marino High School</h1>

    <em>A note about legality:</em>
    <p>The definition of illegal hacking in this country is any unauthorized use of a computer resource. There are many
    perfectly legal things you can do with these skills like helping a friend with a computer they own, or performing
    security testing on a company.  Bottom line: have permission before you use these skills.</p>

    <p>You have my permission to conduct these lessons.</p>

    <h2>Think Like A Hacker</h2>

    <p>Hacking is all about mindset: thinking outside of the box. Much like a scientist, a hacker perturbs a system,
    watches the response, and hypothesises what the response could mean. In these activities, try to find some way to
    break the rules of the system, analyse the response, and hypothesise what happened. </p>

    <em>But wait....what's a system?</em>
    <p>A system, for the purposes of this lesson, is a bunch of related things.  Just like the solar system has a bunch
    of related planets, rocks, a sun, etc. all bound through the rule of gravity, our computer systems involves
    computers people, the internet, etc, all bound by the rule of software.</p>

    <p>You don't need to understand gravity to throw a rock and watch it fall, nor do you need to understand physics to
    try and slow that fall by adding feathers to the rock.  You just need to try something, no matter how crazy. Same
    applies to our systems.  You don't need to know software nor computers.  You just have to try and break them...</p>
